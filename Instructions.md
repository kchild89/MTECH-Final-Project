You will be making a comments section for a social media post. A user will be able to create comments. The user will also be able to edit and delete any of the comments.

Requirements    

Must use html, css, javascript and jQuery.
User can create their own display name with their comment.
Add the posts from newest to oldest(Newest post at the top).
When a user clicks the delete button on a comment remove that comment from the page.
When a user clicks the edit button allow the comment to be edited and change the original comment when submitted.
The original post MUST be fixed on top of the page. Meaning when the user scrolls through the comments the original post("Trying to decide a career path? Programming is the move. Change my mind.") will stay on top of the comments and will always be shown.
The same goes for the creating a comment section. Make sure it is fixed on the bottom of the page and stays on top of the comments as the user scrolls.
Project must be pushed up to github
Turn in the github repository
